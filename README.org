* "Working with Will"
  You're probably reading this because you're going to be working on
  my team. I know what you're thinking: it is pretty odd for a person
  to have a `README`-file... But then again I could probably be
  replaced by a couple of bash-scripts. Hopefully this document will
  help you understand how I work and how I can help you be a really
  great engineer.

* My Job
  I have three main goals:
  - Hire and retain the best engineers (you)
  - Helping define your context, where you use code to solve business problems
  - Helping you solve problems

* My philosophy

  I like Elon Musk's idea of thinking of people on a team as vectors,
  consisting of a magnitude (how productive you are) and a direction
  (the direction you're pulling in).

  My main priorities are ensuring that your direction is aligned with
  the rest of the team and that you are as effective as possible.

  Work is more of a marathon than a sprint: So my goal is always to
  ensure that your performance is sustainable.

* Communication Skills



* My availability
  My priority is always to ensure that you are as effective as
  possible. Feel free to disturb me anytime, even if I have my
  headphones on. If I have a meeting but you need to talk with me I
  will reschedule the meeting.

  If something is important to you, it's important to me. If something
  can't wait you can call me any time, no matter if it's a weekend,
  holiday or in the middle of the night.

* Working hours

  I like working strange hours (and sometimes weekends), so I might
  write you something on Slack pretty much anytime. I only expect you to
  respond during working hours.

  Because of the nature of what we're doing I might sometimes need you
  outside working hours due to some emergency. If there is an emergency
  I will tell you so, if I don't you don't need to.

* Communications
  **Hierarchy of communication:** Video/Face-to-face -> Call -> Text -> Slack -> Email

  Don't email me if you want a prompt response, I have notifications
  turned off for email and try to check my email as seldom as
  possible.

  Use Slack if you want to discuss something with in a semi-async
  manner.

  If something is blocking you, or something that you feel is
  important, please talk to me directly disturb me IRL. Even when I
  have my headphones on.

  In general most of our communication will be either Slack or
  Face-to-face.

* Feedback
  I appreciate feedback both positive and negative about how I'm doing
  and how the team is doing. I think feedback is best given through a
  Slack message or 1-1 chat.

  Giving me feedback is the best way for me to understand what can be
  done better. I will never hold any feedback you give me, as long as
  it is presented to me privately, against you.



* 1on1 Meeting
  Every two-weeks (unless we decide otherwise), we will have a 1on1
  meeting. The 1on1 meeting is entirely for you. This meeting is for
  you to give feedback for me and for the company.

  What we talk about on a 1on1 meeting is 100% confidential, unless
  you ask me to share something.
